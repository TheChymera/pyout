Initial release

This release adds a basic schema for styling columns (defined in
`pyout.SCHEMA`) and the `Tabular` class, which serves as the entry
point for writing tabular output.  The features at this point include
value-based styling, a `rewrite` method that allows the user to update
a previous row, and the ability to update previous fields by defining
asynchronous callback functions.
